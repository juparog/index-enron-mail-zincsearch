Will the switching/loss of demand/storage management keep cash futures spread at reasonable levels or will it blow to $5+. Not too many years ago we had a $50 print on the Hub.  unless we get some crazy prints, you have to question the steep backwardation in the market.  funny watching the flies in the front.  Bot large chunk of g/h/j at $.50 friday morning.  probably worth 1.30 now.  crazy.  people have seen each front spread be weak since forever and are already starting to eye up g/h.  what's the thoughts on distillates...  is it tight enough such that gas switching is the marginal mmbtu of demand and pulls it up or is the market too oversupplied to care?"},

There were several issues and concerns which were voiced, mostly related to BMC's lack of support and suboptimal application capability (that is the \"net\", understated version).Bob, you and I spoke briefly after the meeting regarding what, if anything, BMC could do to \"fix their problem\".  I relayed the gist of our brief conversation to EBS.As discussed in the meeting, EBS has a near-term opportunity to get a deal done with BMC, and it would be of optimum benefit to execute this year.  One of the outcomes of our November 17 meeting is that EBS has been pressing BMC for a BMC commitment to Enron's overall customer satisfaction.  Per a voicemail to me from EBS, it appears that BMC have provided a response to EBS.I would like to schedule a meeting for the addressees of this note for either November 30th, or December 1st.  The purpose is to get an update from the NetWorks team on the BMC application testing that was underway, and for EBS to explain what BMC has proposed.  This meeting should take an hour.  Please let me know if you can meet tomorrow or Friday.  I'll book a room and time that works for the majority, and confirm with a Notes \"Meeting Invitation\".Thank you,Jeff Jeff YoungfleshDirector, Business DevelopmentGlobal Strategic SourcingEnron Corp.333 Clay Street, 11th FloorHouston, TX 77002t:  713-345-5968f:  713-646-2450c:  713-410-6716"},

New passes will be available to Enron employees upon expiration of the 30 day time period. Each zone does have a different fare values based on the distance the bus travels.

I amalso forwarding this to Kelli Wallin in our accounting department to followup on as well.* ACCOUNTING:  Please see that all service charges were posted as 18%,per contract* JEFF: I will fax you the comp ticket showing the 1 hour receptionposted to The Woodlands House account.* ACCOUNTING: Please fax Jeff the back up for the package handlingcharges. $451.35* ACCOUNTING: Please adjust (1) wireless mouse charge for a total of$156.41* JEFF: In regards to the lunch charges, we charged a day guest rateto include lunch in The Woodlands Dining Room @ $57.00 for  40 dayattendees.  You had 80 persons on the Complete Meeting Package.  However,when coordinating with Tracey Kozadinos, she ordered and guaranteed 100 boxlunches @ $5.50 per person surcharge for the golf.  Thus, 80+40=120 - 100(box lunches) would leave 20 persons permitted to have lunch in TheWoodlands Dining Room.  We billed you for the total amount of persons overthe 20 permitted in the Woodlands Dining Room.* JEFF: Breakout charges were for (2) rooms.  Enron had a guarantee of120 attendees.  We allow (1) breakout per 40 attendees.  This particularday, (5) breakouts were ordered.  The audio visual in the additionalbreakouts is based on a-la-carte pricing and is not included in the package.Only av is included in the rooms that are part of the allocation.Jeff, I will see that the adjustments are forwarded to you as soon aspossible in order to remit for payment.

I apologize thatI do not have the calendar availability of the various EnronBroadband Services executives, but given the opportunitiesof having meetings in Basking Ridge either:  (for 1.5 days of a3 day period) December 19 - 21, 2000 or January 9 - 11, 2001;the (tentative) preference leanings are toward reschedulingthe currently proposed dates of December 13/14 to theJanuary 2001 dates.I will keep Thad posted, and he will keep you posted.  Iapologize for any delays or confusion, if any, but I willperiodically check in with you as well, to make sure we'reall on the same path.  My primary communication focus willbe Thad, however, in order to minimize any confusion.Thank you,Jeff YoungfleshDirector, Business DevelopmentGlobal Strategic SourcingEnron Corp.333 Clay Street, 11th FloorHouston, TX 77002t:  713-345-5968f:  713-646-2450c:  713-410-6716----- Forwarded by Jeff Youngflesh/NA/Enron on 11/28/2000 07:39 AM -----                     Jeff                    Youngflesh           To:     thadwhite@avaya.com                                         cc:                    11/21/2000           Subject:     RE: Enron / Avayameetings in Basking Ridge                                      10:44 AM  Thad, can you give Barbara a \"hold\" on this until you and I get thepeople scheduled?

For the 2nd day (full-day session),Thursday, December 14th.Serge has indicated his availability for a 2-hour block of time,on the 13th in the afternoon.  That meeting would be essentiallyan executive overview and strategy session for the appropriateAvaya executives and the Enron Broadband Services exec-utives.  The bulk of that meeting would be EBS' presentationof their Value Proposition for the potential EBS/Avaya efforts.The second day would be for members of Avaya's engineeringand development organizations, and possibly marketing; tohave a full day to meet with the equivalent EBS team.  Bothsoftware/firmware and product platform-type of concepts wouldbe examined, and any other area in which EBS and Avayadevelopment folks felt that there were possible synergies fora solution or solutions for the following 2 primary areas:1)  \"sell to\":  EBS solutions to Avaya for internal use, and2)  \"sell through \u0026 sell with\":  EBS and Avaya possiblydeveloping a solution for bringing to market in a similarfashion to the Avaya/Siebel Systems' efforts.By way of copying this to the EBS team, I am asking thatthey will coordinate with me whom they would be sending,and to make sure that the 13th/14th of December fit intothe appropriate calendars.  If there are any Avaya questionsrelated to development/engineering efforts, I would coordinateas well, and most likely route to Larry Ciscon, or other EBSengineering/development executive(s), as appropriate.Thank you again for your help, and we look forward to theopportunity!Jeff YoungfleshDirector, Business DevelopmentGlobal Strategic SourcingEnron Corp.333 Clay Street, 11th FloorHouston, TX 77002t:  713-345-5968f:  713-646-2450c:  713-410-6716                    \"Korp,                    Barbara I            To:     \"White, Thad (Thad)\"\u003cthadwhite@avaya.com\u003e,                    (Barbara)\"           \"'jeff.youngflesh@enron.com'\"\u003cjeff.youngflesh@enron.com\u003e                    \u003cbkorp@avaya.        cc:                    com\u003e                 Subject:     RE: EnronOrganization                    11/15/2000                    02:55 PMJeff \u0026 Thad,I spoke with Serge this afternoon.
